Objectives

The  overarching  objective  of  this  Code  of  Practice  (“Code”)  is  to  improve  the  functioning  of  the
internal market, to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (“AI”),
while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, and fundamental rights enshrined in the
Charter, including democracy, the rule of law, and environmental protection, against harmful effects
of AI in the Union, and to support innovation pursuant to Article 1(1) AI Act.

To achieve this overarching objective, the specific objectives of this Code are:

A.  To serve as a guiding document for demonstrating compliance with the obligations provided
for in Articles 53 and 55 AI Act, while recognising that adherence to the Code does not
constitute conclusive evidence of compliance with these obligations under the AI Act.

B.  To ensure providers of general-purpose AI models comply with their obligations under the AI
Act  and  to  enable  the  AI  Office  to  assess  compliance  of  providers  of  general-purpose  AI
models who choose to rely on the Code to demonstrate compliance with their obligations
under the AI Act.

Recitals
Whereas:

(a)  Principle of Appropriate Lifecycle Management. The Signatories recognise that providers of
general-purpose  AI  models  with  systemic  risk  should  continuously  assess  and  mitigate
systemic risks, taking appropriate measures along the entire model lifecycle (including during
development  that  occurs  before  and  after  a  model  has  been  placed  on  the  market),
cooperating with and taking into account relevant actors along the AI value chain (such as
stakeholders  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  model),  and  ensuring  their  systemic  risk
management is made future-proof by regular updates in response to improving and emerging
model capabilities (see recitals 114 and 115 AI Act). Accordingly, the Signatories recognise
that implementing appropriate measures will often require Signatories to adopt at least the
state  of  the  art,  unless  systemic  risk  can  be  conclusively  ruled  out  with  a  less  advanced
process, measure, methodology, method, or technique. Systemic risk assessment is a multi-
step  process  and  model  evaluations,  referring  to  a  range  of  methods  used  in  assessing
systemic risks of models, are  integral along the entire model lifecycle. When systemic risk
mitigations  are  implemented,  the  Signatories  recognise  the  importance  of  continuously
assessing their effectiveness.

(b)  Principle of Contextual Risk Assessment and Mitigation. The Signatories recognise that this
Safety and Security Chapter (“Chapter”) is only relevant for providers of general-purpose AI
models with systemic risk and not AI systems. However, the Signatories also recognise that
the assessment and mitigation of systemic risks should include, as reasonably foreseeable,
the system architecture, other software into which the model may be integrated, and the
computing resources available at inference time because of their importance to the model’s
effects, for example by affecting the effectiveness of safety and security mitigations.

(c)  Principle of Proportionality to Systemic Risks. The Signatories recognise that the assessment
and mitigation of systemic risks should be proportionate to the risks (Article 56(2), point (d)
AI  Act).  Therefore,  the  degree  of  scrutiny  in  systemic  risk  assessment  and  mitigation,  in
particular the level of detail in documentation and reporting, should be proportionate to the
systemic  risks  at  the  relevant  points  along  the  entire  model  lifecycle.  The  Signatories
recognise that while systemic risk assessment and mitigation is iterative and continuous, they
need not duplicate assessments that are still appropriate to the systemic risks stemming from
the model.

(d)  Principle of Integration with Existing Laws. The Signatories recognise that this Chapter forms
part of, and is complemented by, other Union laws. The Signatories further recognise that
confidentiality (including commercial confidentiality) obligations are preserved to the extent
required  by  Union  law,  and  information  sent  to  the  European  AI  Office  (“AI  Office”)  in
adherence  to  this  Chapter  will  be  treated  pursuant  to  Article  78  AI  Act.  Additionally,  the
Signatories  recognise  that  information  about  future  developments  and  future  business
activities  that  they  submit  to  the  AI  Office  will  be  understood  as  subject  to  change.  The
Signatories further recognise that the Measure under this Chapter to promote a healthy risk
culture  (Measure  8.3)  is  without  prejudice  to  any  obligations  arising  from  Directive  (EU)
2019/1937 on the protection of whistleblowers and implementing laws of Member States in
conjunction with Article 87 AI Act. The Signatories also recognise that they may be able to
rely on international standards to the extent they cover the provisions of this Chapter.

3


(e)  Principle  of  Cooperation.  The  Signatories  recognise  that  systemic  risk  assessment  and
mitigation merit significant investment of time and resources. They recognise the advantages
of collaborative efficiency, e.g. by sharing model evaluations methods and/or infrastructure.
The Signatories further recognise the importance of cooperation with licensees, downstream
modifiers,  and  downstream  providers  in  systemic  risk  assessment  and  mitigation,  and  of
engaging  expert  or  lay  representatives  of  civil  society,  academia,  and  other  relevant
stakeholders  in  understanding  the  model  effects.  The  Signatories  recognise  that  such
cooperation may involve entering into agreements to share information relevant to systemic
risk  assessment  and  mitigation,  while  ensuring  proportionate  protection  of  sensitive
information and compliance with applicable Union law. The Signatories further recognise the
importance  of  cooperating  with  the  AI  Office  (Article  53(3)  AI  Act)  to  foster  collaboration
between  providers  of  general-purpose  AI  models  with  systemic  risk,  researchers,  and
regulatory bodies to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the AI landscape.

(f)  Principle of Innovation in AI Safety and Security. The Signatories recognise that determining
the  most  effective  methods  for  understanding  and  ensuring  the  safety  and  security  of
general-purpose AI models with systemic risk remains an evolving challenge. The Signatories
recognise that this Chapter should encourage providers of general-purpose AI models with
systemic risk to advance the state of the art in AI safety and security and related processes
and  measures.  The  Signatories  recognise  that  advancing  the  state  of the  art  also  includes
developing  targeted  methods  that  specifically  address  risks  while  maintaining  beneficial
capabilities (e.g. mitigating biosecurity risks without unduly reducing beneficial biomedical
capabilities),  acknowledging  that  such  precision  demands  greater  technical  effort  and
innovation than less targeted methods. The Signatories further recognise that if providers of
general-purpose AI models with systemic risk can demonstrate equal or superior safety or
security  outcomes  through  alternative  means  that  achieve  greater  efficiency,  such
innovations should be recognised as advancing the state of the art in AI safety and security
and meriting consideration for wider adoption.

(g)  Precautionary Principle. The Signatories recognise the important role of the Precautionary
Principle, particularly for systemic risks for which the lack or quality of scientific data does not
yet  permit  a  complete  assessment.  Accordingly,  the  Signatories  recognise  that  the
extrapolation of current adoption rates and research and development trajectories of models
should be taken into account for the identification of systemic risks.

(h)  Small  and  medium  enterprises  (“SMEs”)  and  small  mid-cap  enterprises  (“SMCs”).  To
account for differences between providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk
regarding their size and capacity, simplified ways of compliance for SMEs and SMCs, including
startups,  should  be  possible  as  proportionate.  For  example,  SMEs  and  SMCs  may  be
exempted from some reporting commitments (Article 56(5) AI Act). Signatories that are SMEs
or  SMCs  and  are  exempted  from  reporting  commitments  recognise  that  they  may
nonetheless voluntarily adhere to them.

4


(i)  Interpretation.  The  Signatories  recognise  that  all  Commitments  and  Measures  shall  be
interpreted  in  light  of  the  objective  to  assess  and  mitigate  systemic  risks.  The  Signatories
further  recognise  that  given  the  rapid  pace  of  AI  development,  purposive  interpretation
focused on systemic risk assessment and mitigation is particularly important to ensure this
Chapter  remains effective,  relevant,  and  future-proof.  Additionally,  any  term  appearing  in
this Chapter that is defined in the Glossary for this Chapter has the meaning set forth in that
Glossary. The  Signatories recognise that  Appendix  1 should be interpreted, in instances of
doubt,  in  good  faith  in  light  of:  (1)  the  probability  and  severity  of  harm  pursuant  to  the
definition of ‘risk’ in Article 3(2) AI Act; and (2) the definition of ‘systemic risk’ in Article 3(65)
AI Act. The Signatories recognise that this Chapter is to be interpreted in conjunction and in
accordance with any AI Office guidance on the AI Act.

(j)  Serious Incident Reporting. The Signatories recognise that the reporting of a serious incident
is not an admission of wrongdoing. Further, they recognise that relevant information about
serious incidents cannot be kept track of, documented, and reported at the model level only
in  retrospect  after  a  serious  incident  has  occurred.  The  information  that  could  directly  or
indirectly  lead  up  to  such  an  event  is  often  dispersed  and  may  be  lost,  overwritten,  or
fragmented  by the  time  Signatories  become  aware  of  a  serious  incident. This  justifies  the
establishment  of  processes  and  measures  to  keep  track  of  and  document  relevant
information before serious incidents occur.

Commitment 1 Safety and Security Framework

LEGAL TEXT: Articles 55(1) and 56(5), and recitals 110, 114, and 115 AI Act

Signatories commit to adopting a state-of-the-art Safety and Security Framework (“Framework”). The
purpose of the Framework is to outline the systemic risk management processes and measures that
Signatories implement to ensure the systemic risks stemming from their models are acceptable.

Signatories commit to a Framework adoption process that involves three steps:

(1)  creating the Framework (as specified in Measure 1.1);

(2)  implementing the Framework (as specified in Measure 1.2); and

(3)  updating the Framework (as specified in Measure 1.3).

Further, Signatories commit to notifying the AI Office of their Framework (as specified in Measure
1.4).

Figure 1. Process for creating, implementing, and updating Frameworks.
The text of the Commitments and Measures takes precedence.

Measure 1.1 Creating the Framework

Signatories  will  create  a  state-of-the-art  Framework,  taking  into  account  the  models  they  are
developing, making available on the market, and/or using.

The  Framework  will  contain  a  high-level  description  of  implemented  and  planned  processes  and
measures for systemic risk assessment and mitigation to adhere to this Chapter.

In addition, the Framework will contain:

(1)  a description and justification of the trigger points and their usage, at which the Signatories
will conduct additional lighter-touch model evaluations along the entire model lifecycle, as
specified in Measure 1.2, second paragraph, point (1)(a);

6


(2)  for  the  Signatories’  determination  of  whether  systemic  risk  is  considered  acceptable,  as

specified in Commitment 4:

(a)  a description and justification of the systemic risk acceptance criteria, including the

systemic risk tiers, and their usage as specified in Measure 4.1;

(b)  a  high-level  description  of  what  safety  and  security  mitigations  Signatories  would

need to implement once each systemic risk tier is reached;

(c)  for each systemic risk that Signatories defined systemic risk tiers for as specified in
Measure 4.1, estimates of timelines when Signatories reasonably foresee that they
will have a model that exceeds the highest systemic risk tier already reached by any
of their existing models. Such estimates: (i) may consist of time ranges or probability
distributions; and (ii) may take into account aggregate forecasts, surveys, and other
estimates produced with other providers. Further, such estimates will be supported
by justifications, including underlying assumptions and uncertainties; and

(d)  a  description  of  whether  and,  if  so,  by  what  process  input  from  external  actors,
including  governments,  influences  proceeding  with  the  development,  making
available  on  the  market,  and/or  use  of  the  Signatories’  models  as  specified  in
Measure 4.2, other than as the result of independent external evaluations;

(3)  a  description  of  how  systemic  risk  responsibility  is  allocated  for  the  processes  by  which

systemic risk is assessed and mitigated as specified in Commitment 8; and

(4)  a description of the process by which Signatories will update the Framework, including how
they will determine that an updated Framework is confirmed, as specified in Measure 1.3.

Signatories will have confirmed the Framework no later than four weeks  after having notified the
Commission pursuant to Article 52(1) AI Act and no later than two weeks before placing the model
on the market.

Measure 1.2 Implementing the Framework

Signatories will implement the processes and measures outlined in their Framework as specified in
the following paragraphs.

Along the entire model lifecycle, Signatories will continuously:

(1)  assess the systemic risks stemming from the model by:

(a)  conducting lighter-touch model evaluations that need not adhere to Appendix 3 (e.g.
automated evaluations) at appropriate trigger points defined in terms of, e.g. time,
training  compute,  development  stages,  user  access,  inference  compute,  and/or
affordances;

(b)  conducting  post-market  monitoring  after  placing  the  model  on  the  market,  as

specified in Measure 3.5;

(c)  taking  into  account  relevant  information  about  serious  incidents  (pursuant  to

Commitment 9); and

(d)  increasing the breadth and/or depth of assessment or conducting a full systemic risk
assessment and mitigation process that is specified in the following paragraph, based
on the results of points (a), (b), and (c); and

7


(2)  implement  systemic  risk  mitigations  taking  into  account  the  results  of  point  (1),  including

addressing serious incidents as appropriate.

Figure 2. Illustrative timeline of systemic risk assessment and mitigation along the model lifecycle.
The text of the Commitments and Measures takes precedence.

In addition, Signatories will  implement a full systemic risk assessment and mitigation process that
involves  four  steps,  without  needing  to  duplicate  parts  of  the  model’s  previous  systemic  risk
assessments that are still appropriate:

(1)  identifying the systemic risks stemming from the model as specified in Commitment 2;

(2)  analysing each identified systemic risk as specified in Commitment 3;

(3)  determining whether the systemic risks stemming from the model are acceptable as specified

in Measure 4.1; and

(4)  if  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  the  model  are  not  determined  to  be  acceptable,
implementing safety and/or security mitigations as specified in Commitments 5 and 6, and
re-assessing the systemic risks stemming from the model starting from point (1), as specified
in Measure 4.2.

Signatories will conduct such a full systemic risk assessment and mitigation process at least before
placing the model on the market and whenever the conditions specified in Measure  7.6, first and
third paragraph, are met. Signatories will report their implemented measures and processes to the
AI Office as specified in Commitment 7.

The text of the Commitments and Measures takes precedence.

Measure 1.3 Updating the Framework

Signatories  will  update  the  Framework  as  appropriate,  including  without  undue  delay  after  a
Framework assessment (specified in the following paragraphs), to ensure the information in Measure
1.1  is  kept  up-to-date  and  the  Framework  is  at  least  state-of-the-art.  For  any  update  of  the
Framework, Signatories will include a changelog, describing how and why the Framework has been
updated, along with a version number and the date of change.

Signatories will conduct an appropriate Framework assessment, if they have reasonable grounds to
believe that the adequacy of their Framework and/or their adherence thereto has been or will be
materially undermined, or every 12 months starting from their placing of the model on the market,
whichever is sooner. Examples of such grounds are:

(1)  how the Signatories develop models will change materially, which can be reasonably foreseen
to lead to the systemic risks stemming from at least one of their models not being acceptable;

(2)  serious incidents and/or near misses involving their models or similar models that are likely
to  indicate  that  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  at  least  one  of  their  models  are  not
acceptable have occurred; and/or

(3)  the systemic risks stemming from at least one of their models have changed or are likely to
change  materially,  e.g.  safety  and/or  security  mitigations  have  become  or  are  likely  to
become materially less effective, or at least one of their models has developed or is likely to
develop materially changed capabilities and/or propensities.

9


A Framework assessment will include the following:

(1)  Framework  adequacy:  An  assessment  of  whether  the  processes  and  measures  in  the
Framework are appropriate for the systemic risks stemming from the Signatories’ models.
This  assessment  will  take  into  account  how  the  models  are  currently  being  developed,
made available on the market, and/or used, and how they are expected to be developed,
made available on the market, and/or used over the next 12 months.

(2)  Framework  adherence:  An  assessment  focused  on  the  Signatories’  adherence  to  the
Framework, including: (a) any instances of, and reasons for, non-adherence to the Framework
since  the  last Framework assessment; and (b) any measures,  including safety and security
mitigations, that need to be implemented to ensure continued adherence to the Framework.
If  point(s)  (a)  and/or  (b)  give  rise  to  risks  of  future  non-adherence,  Signatories  will  make
remediation plans as part of their Framework assessment.

Measure 1.4 Framework notifications

Signatories  will  provide  the  AI  Office  with  (unredacted)  access  to  their  Framework,  and  updates
thereof, within five business days of either being confirmed.

Commitment 2 Systemic risk identification

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1) and recital 110 AI Act

Signatories  commit  to  identifying  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  the  model.  The  purpose  of
systemic risk identification includes facilitating systemic risk analysis (pursuant to Commitment 3) and
systemic risk acceptance determination (pursuant to Commitment 4).

Systemic risk identification involves two elements:

(1)  following a structured process to identify the systemic risks stemming from the model (as

specified in Measure 2.1); and

(2)  developing  systemic  risk  scenarios  for  each  identified  systemic  risk  (as  specified  in

Measure 2.2).

10


Figure 4. Systemic risk identification process. The text of the Commitments and Measures takes precedence.

Measure 2.1 Systemic risk identification process

Signatories will identify:

(1)  the systemic risks obtained through the following process:

(a)  compiling a list of risks that could stem from the model and be systemic, based on

the types of risks in Appendix 1.1, taking into account:

(i)  model-independent information (pursuant to Measure 3.1);
(ii)

relevant  information  about  the  model  and  similar  models,  including
information  from  post-market  monitoring  (pursuant  to  Measure  3.5),  and
information  about  serious
incidents  and  near  misses  (pursuant  to
Commitment 9); and
any other relevant information communicated directly or via public releases
to the Signatory by the AI Office, the Scientific Panel of Independent Experts,
or other initiatives, such as the International Network of AI Safety Institutes,
endorsed for this purpose by the AI Office;

(iii)

(b)  analysing relevant characteristics of the risks compiled pursuant to point (a), such as
their nature (based on Appendix 1.2) and sources (based on Appendix 1.3); and

(c)  identifying, based on point (b), the systemic risks stemming from the model; and

(2)  the specified systemic risks in Appendix 1.4.

Measure 2.2 Systemic risk scenarios

Signatories will develop appropriate systemic risk scenarios, including regarding the number and level
of detail of these systemic risk scenarios, for each identified systemic risk (pursuant to Measure 2.1).

11


Commitment 3 Systemic risk analysis

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1) and recital 114 AI Act

Signatories  commit  to  analysing  each  identified  systemic  risk  (pursuant  to  Commitment  2).  The
purpose  of  systemic  risk  analysis  includes  facilitating  systemic  risk  acceptance  determination
(pursuant to Commitment 4).

Systemic risk analysis involves five elements for each identified systemic risk, which may overlap and
may need to be implemented recursively:

(1)  gathering model-independent information (as specified in Measure 3.1);

(2)  conducting model evaluations (as specified in Measure 3.2);

(3)  modelling the systemic risk (as specified in Measure 3.3); and

(4)  estimating the systemic risk (as specified in Measure 3.4); while

(5)  conducting post-market monitoring (as specified in Measure 3.5).

Measure 3.1 Model-independent information

Signatories will gather model-independent information relevant to the systemic risk.

Signatories will search for and gather such information with varying degrees of breadth and depth
appropriate for the systemic risk, using methods such as:

(1)  web  searches  (e.g.  making  use  of  open-source  intelligence  methods  in  collecting  and

analysing information gathered from open sources);

(2)  literature reviews;

(3)  market analyses (e.g. focused on capabilities of other models available on the market);

(4)  reviews of training data (e.g. for indications of data poisoning or tampering);

(5)  reviewing and analysing historical incident data and incident databases;

(6)  forecasting  of  general  trends  (e.g.  forecasts  concerning  the  development  of  algorithmic

efficiency, compute use, data availability, and energy use);

(7)  expert interviews and/or panels; and/or

(8)  lay interviews, surveys, community consultations, or other participatory research methods
investigating, e.g. the effects of models on natural persons, including vulnerable groups.

Measure 3.2 Model evaluations

Signatories will conduct at least state-of-the-art model evaluations in the modalities relevant to the
systemic risk to assess the model’s capabilities, propensities, affordances, and/or effects, as specified
in Appendix 3.

Signatories will ensure that such model evaluations are designed and conducted using methods that
are appropriate for the model and the systemic risk, and include open-ended testing of the model to
improve the understanding of the systemic risk, with a view to identifying unexpected behaviours,

12


capability boundaries, or emergent properties. Examples of model evaluation methods are: Q&A sets,
task-based evaluations, benchmarks, red-teaming and other methods of adversarial testing, human
uplift  studies,  model  organisms,  simulations,  and/or  proxy  evaluations  for  classified  materials.
Further, the design of the model evaluations will be informed by the model-independent information
gathered pursuant to Measure 3.1.

Measure 3.3 Systemic risk modelling

Signatories will conduct systemic risk modelling for the systemic risk. To this end, Signatories will:

(1)  use at least state-of-the-art risk modelling methods;

(2)  build on the systemic risk scenarios developed pursuant to Measure 2.2; and

(3)  take  into  account  at  least  the  information  gathered  pursuant  to  Measure  2.1  and  this

Commitment.

Measure 3.4 Systemic risk estimation

Signatories will estimate the probability and severity of harm for the systemic risk.

Signatories will use at least state-of-the-art risk estimation methods and take into account at least
the  information  gathered  pursuant  to  Commitment  2,  this  Commitment,  and  Commitment  9.
Estimates of systemic risk will be expressed as a risk score, risk matrix, probability distribution, or in
other adequate formats, and may be quantitative, semi-quantitative, and/or qualitative. Examples of
such estimates of systemic risks are: (1) a qualitative systemic risk score (e.g. “moderate” or “critical”);
(2)  a  qualitative  systemic  risk  matrix  (e.g.  “probability:  unlikely”  x  “impact:  high”);  and/or  (3)  a
quantitative systemic risk matrix (e.g. “X-Y%” x “X-Y EUR damage”).

Measure 3.5 Post-market monitoring

Signatories  will  conduct  appropriate  post-market  monitoring  to  gather  information  relevant  to
assessing whether the systemic risk could be determined to not be acceptable (pursuant to Measure
4.1) and to inform whether a Model Report update is necessary (pursuant to Measure 7.6). Further,
Signatories will use best efforts to conduct post-market monitoring to gather information relevant to
producing estimates of timelines (pursuant to Measure 1.1, point (2)(c)).

To these ends, post-market monitoring will:

(1)  gather information about the model’s capabilities, propensities, affordances, and/or effects;

(2)  take into account the exemplary methods listed below; and

(3)  if Signatories themselves provide and/or deploy AI systems that integrate their own model,

include monitoring the model as part of these AI systems.

The following are examples of post-market monitoring methods for the purpose of point (2) above:

(1)  collecting end-user feedback;

(2)  providing (anonymous) reporting channels;

(3)  providing (serious) incident reporting forms;

(4)  providing bug bounties;

13


(5)  establishing community-driven model evaluations and public leaderboards;

(6)  conducting frequent dialogues with affected stakeholders;

(7)  monitoring  software  repositories,  known malware,  public  forums,  and/or  social  media  for

patterns of use;

(8)  supporting the scientific study of the model’s capabilities, propensities, affordances, and/or
effects  in  collaboration  with  academia,  civil  society,  regulators,  and/or  independent
researchers;

(9)  implementing privacy-preserving logging and metadata  analysis techniques of the  model’s
inputs and outputs using, e.g. watermarks, metadata, and/or other at least state-of-the-art
provenance techniques;

(10) collecting  relevant  information  about  breaches  of  the  model’s  use  restrictions  and

subsequent incidents arising from such breaches; and/or

(11) monitoring aspects of models that are relevant for assessing and mitigating systemic risk and
are not transparent to third parties, e.g. hidden chains-of-thought for models for which the
parameters are not publicly available for download.

To facilitate post-market monitoring, Signatories will provide an adequate number of independent
external evaluators with adequate free access to:

(1)  the  model’s  most  capable  model  version(s)  with  regard  to  the  systemic  risk  that  is  made

available on the market;

(2)  the chains-of-thought of the model version(s) in point (1), if available; and

(3)  the model version(s) corresponding to the model version(s) in point (1) with the fewest safety
mitigations  implemented with  regard to  the systemic  risk  (such  as the  helpful-only  model
version, if it exists) and, as available, its chains-of-thought;

unless the model is considered a similarly safe or safer model with regard to the same systemic risk
(pursuant to Appendix 2.2). Such access to a model may be provided by Signatories through an API,
on-premise access (including transport), access via Signatory-provided hardware, or by making the
model parameters publicly available for download, as appropriate.

For  the  purpose  of  selecting  independent  external  evaluators  for  the  preceding  paragraph,
Signatories will publish suitable criteria for assessing applications. The number of such evaluators, the
selection  criteria,  and  security  measures  may  differ  for  points  (1),  (2),  and  (3)  in  the  preceding
paragraph.

Signatories  will  only  access,  store,  and/or  analyse  evaluation  results  from  independent  external
evaluators to assess and mitigate systemic risk from the model. In particular, Signatories refrain from
training their models on the inputs and/or outputs from such test runs without express permission
from the evaluators. Additionally, Signatories will not take any legal or technical retaliation against
the independent external evaluators as a consequence of their testing and/or publication of findings
as long as the evaluators:

(1)  do  not  intentionally  disrupt  model  availability  through  the  testing,  unless  expressly

permitted;

(2)  do not intentionally access, modify, and/or use sensitive or confidential user data in violation
of Union law, and if evaluators do access such data, collect only what is necessary, refrain
from disseminating it, and delete it as soon as legally feasible;

14


(3)  do not intentionally use their access for activities that pose a significant risk to public safety

and security;

(4)  do not use findings to threaten Signatories, users, or other actors in the value chain, provided
that disclosure under pre-agreed policies and timelines will not be counted as such coercion;
and

(5)  adhere to the Signatory’s publicly available procedure for responsible vulnerability disclosure,
which will specify at least that the Signatory cannot delay or block publication for more than
30 business days from the date that the Signatory is made aware  of the findings, unless a
longer timeline is exceptionally necessary such as if disclosure of the findings would materially
increase the systemic risk.

Signatories that are SMEs or SMCs may contact the AI Office, which may provide support or resources
to facilitate adherence to this Measure.

Commitment 4 Systemic risk acceptance determination

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1) AI Act

Signatories  commit  to  specifying  systemic  risk  acceptance  criteria  and  determining  whether  the
systemic risks  stemming from the  model are  acceptable (as specified in Measure  4.1). Signatories
commit to deciding whether or not to proceed with the development, the making available on the
market,  and/or  the  use  of  the  model  based  on  the  systemic  risk  acceptance  determination  (as
specified in Measure 4.2).

Measure 4.1 Systemic risk acceptance criteria and acceptance determination

Signatories will describe and justify (in the Framework pursuant to Measure 1.1, point (2)(a)) how
they will determine whether the systemic risks stemming from the model are acceptable. To do so,
Signatories will:

(1)  for each identified systemic risk (pursuant to Measure 2.1), at least:

(a)  define appropriate systemic risk tiers that:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

are defined in terms of model capabilities, and may additionally incorporate
model propensities, risk estimates, and/or other suitable metrics;

are measurable; and

comprise  at  least  one  systemic  risk  tier  that  has  not  been  reached  by  the
model; or

(b)  define other appropriate systemic risk acceptance criteria, if systemic risk tiers are
not suitable for the systemic risk and the systemic risk is not a specified systemic risk
(pursuant to Appendix 1.4);

(2)  describe  how  they  will  use  these  tiers  and/or  other  criteria  to  determine  whether  each
identified  systemic  risk  (pursuant  to  Measure  2.1)  and  the  overall  systemic  risk  are
acceptable; and

15


(3)  justify how the use of these tiers and/or other criteria pursuant to point (2) ensures that each
identified  systemic  risk  (pursuant  to  Measure  2.1)  and  the  overall  systemic  risk  are
acceptable.

Signatories will apply the systemic risk acceptance criteria to each identified systemic risk (pursuant
to Measure 2.1), incorporating a safety margin (as specified in the following paragraph), to determine
whether  each  identified  systemic  risk  (pursuant  to Measure  2.1)  and the overall  systemic  risk  are
acceptable. This acceptance determination will take into account at least the information gathered
via systemic risk identification and analysis (pursuant to Commitments 2 and 3).

The safety margin will:

(1)  be appropriate for the systemic risk; and

(2)  take into account potential limitations, changes, and uncertainties of:

(a)  systemic risk sources (e.g. capability improvements after the time of assessment);

(b)  systemic  risk  assessments (e.g.  under-elicitation of model evaluations or  historical

accuracy of similar assessments); and

(c)  the  effectiveness  of  safety  and  security  mitigations  (e.g.  mitigations  being

circumvented, deactivated, or subverted).

Measure  4.2  Proceeding  or  not  proceeding  based  on  systemic  risk  acceptance
determination

Signatories will only proceed with the development, the making available on the market, and/or the
use of the model, if the systemic risks stemming from the model are determined to be acceptable
(pursuant to Measure 4.1).

If the systemic risks stemming from the model are not determined to be acceptable or are reasonably
foreseeable to be soon not determined to be acceptable (pursuant to Measure 4.1), Signatories will
take appropriate measures to ensure the systemic risks stemming from the model are and will remain
acceptable prior to proceeding. In particular, Signatories will:

(1)  not make the model available on the market, restrict the making available on the market (e.g.
via adjusting licenses or usage restrictions), withdraw, or recall the model, as necessary;

(2)  implement safety and/or security mitigations (pursuant to Commitments 5 and 6); and

(3)  conduct another round of systemic risk identification (pursuant to Commitment 2), systemic
risk  analysis  (pursuant  to  Commitment  3),  and  systemic  risk  acceptance  determination
(pursuant to this Commitment).

16


Commitment 5 Safety mitigations

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1) and recital 114 AI Act

Signatories commit to implementing appropriate safety mitigations along the entire model lifecycle,
as specified in the Measure for this Commitment, to ensure the systemic risks stemming from the
model are acceptable (pursuant to Commitment 4).

Measure 5.1 Appropriate safety mitigations

Signatories will implement safety mitigations that are appropriate, including sufficiently robust under
adversarial pressure (e.g. fine-tuning attacks or jailbreaking), taking into account the model’s release
and distribution strategy.

Examples of safety mitigations are:

(1)  filtering  and  cleaning  training  data,  e.g.  data  that  might  result  in  undesirable  model

propensities such as unfaithful chain-of-thought traces;

(2)  monitoring and filtering the model’s inputs and/or outputs;

(3)  changing the  model behaviour in the interests of safety, such as fine-tuning the model to

refuse certain requests or provide unhelpful responses;

(4)  staging  the  access  to  the  model,  e.g.  by  limiting  API  access  to  vetted  users,  gradually
expanding  access  based  on  post-market  monitoring,  and/or  not  making  the  model
parameters publicly available for download initially;

(5)  offering tools for other actors to use to mitigate the systemic risks stemming from the model;

(6)  techniques  that  provide  high-assurance  quantitative  safety  guarantees  concerning  the

model’s behaviour;

(7)  techniques to enable safe ecosystems of AI agents, such as model identifications, specialised

communication protocols, or incident monitoring tools; and/or

(8)  other emerging safety mitigations, such as for achieving transparency into chain-of-thought
reasoning or defending against a model’s ability to subvert its other safety mitigations.

17


Commitment 6 Security mitigations

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1), and recitals 114 and 115 AI Act

Signatories commit to implementing an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for their models
and their physical infrastructure along the entire model lifecycle, as specified in the Measures for this
Commitment,  to  ensure  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  their  models  that  could  arise  from
unauthorised  releases,  unauthorised  access,  and/or  model  theft  are  acceptable  (pursuant  to
Commitment 4).

A model is exempt from this Commitment if the model’s capabilities are inferior to the capabilities of
at least one model for which the parameters are publicly available for download.

Signatories  will  implement  these  security  mitigations  for  a  model  until  its  parameters  are  made
publicly available for download or securely deleted.

Measure 6.1 Security Goal

Signatories  will  define  a  goal  that  specifies  the  threat  actors  that  their  security  mitigations  are
intended to protect against (“Security Goal”), including non-state external threats, insider threats,
and other expected threat actors, taking into account at least the current and expected capabilities
of their models.

Measure 6.2 Appropriate security mitigations

Signatories will implement appropriate security mitigations to meet the Security Goal, including the
security mitigations pursuant to Appendix 4. If Signatories deviate from any of the security mitigations
listed in Appendices 4.1 to 4.5, points (a), e.g. due to the Signatory’s organisational context and digital
infrastructure,  they  will  implement  alternative  security  mitigations  that  achieve  the  respective
mitigation objectives.

The implementation of the required security mitigations may be staged appropriately in line with the
increase in model capabilities along the entire model lifecycle.

Commitment 7 Safety and Security Model Reports

LEGAL TEXT: Articles 55(1) and 56(5) AI Act

Signatories commit to reporting to the AI Office information about their model and their systemic risk
assessment and mitigation processes and measures by creating a Safety and Security Model Report
(“Model Report”) before placing a model on the market (as specified in Measures 7.1 to 7.5). Further,
Signatories  commit  to  keeping  the  Model  Report  up-to-date  (as  specified  in  Measure  7.6)  and
notifying the AI Office of their Model Report (as specified in Measure 7.7).

18


If  Signatories  have  already  provided  relevant  information  to the  AI Office  in other  reports and/or
notifications,  they  may  reference  those  reports  and/or  notifications  in  their  Model  Report.
Signatories may create a single Model Report for several models if the systemic risk assessment and
mitigation processes and measures for one model cannot be understood without reference to the
other model(s).

Signatories that are SMEs or SMCs may reduce the level of detail in their Model Report to the extent
necessary to reflect size and capacity constraints.

Measure 7.1 Model description and behaviour

Signatories will provide in the Model Report:

(1)  a  high-level  description  of  the  model’s  architecture,  capabilities,  propensities,  and
affordances, and how the model has been developed, including its training method and data,
as well as how these differ from other models they have made available on the market;

(2)  a description of how the model has been used and is expected to be used, including its use in

the development, oversight, and/or evaluation of models;

(3)  a description of the model versions that are going to be made or are currently made available
on the market and/or used, including differences in systemic risk mitigations and systemic
risks; and

(4)  a  specification  (e.g.  via  valid  hyperlinks)  of  how  Signatories  intend  the  model  to  operate

(often known as a “model specification”), including by:

(a)  specifying the principles that the model is intended to follow;

(b)  stating  how  the  model  is  intended  to  prioritise  different  kinds  of  principles  and

instructions;

(c)  listing topics on which the model is intended to refuse instructions; and

(d)  providing the system prompt.

Measure 7.2 Reasons for proceeding

Signatories will provide in the Model Report:

(1)  a detailed justification for why the systemic risks stemming from the model are acceptable,

including details of the safety margins incorporated (pursuant to Measure 4.1);

(2)  the  reasonably  foreseeable  conditions  under  which  the  justification  in  point  (1)  would  no

longer hold; and

(3)  a description of how the decision to proceed with the development, making available on the
market,  and/or  use  (pursuant  to  Measure  4.2)  was  made,  including  whether  input  from
external actors informed such a decision (pursuant to Measure 1.1, point (2)(d)), and whether
and  how  input  from  independent  external  evaluators  pursuant  to  Appendix  3.5  informed
such a decision.

19


Measure 7.3 Documentation of systemic risk identification, analysis, and mitigation

Signatories will provide in the Model Report:

(1)  a  description  of  the  results  of  their  systemic  risk  identification  and  analysis  and  any

information relevant to understanding them including:

(a)  a description of their systemic risk identification process for risks belonging to the

types of risks in Appendix 1.1 (pursuant to Measure 2.1, point (1));

(b)  explanations of uncertainties and assumptions about how the model would be used

and integrated into AI systems;

(c)  a  description  of  the  results  of  their  systemic  risk  modelling  for  the  systemic  risks

(pursuant to Measure 3.3);

(d)  a  description  of  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  the  model  and  a  justification
therefor, including: (i) the systemic risk estimates (pursuant to Measure 3.4); and (ii)
a  comparison  between  systemic  risks  with  safety  and  security  mitigations
implemented and with the model fully elicited (pursuant to Appendix 3.2);

(e)  all  results  of  model  evaluations  relevant  to  understanding  the  systemic  risks
stemming  from  the  model  and  descriptions  of:  (i)  how  the  evaluations  were
conducted; (ii) the tests  and tasks involved in the model evaluations; (iii) how the
model  evaluations  were  scored;  (iv)  how  the  model  was  elicited  (pursuant  to
Appendix 3.2); (v) how the scores compare to human baselines (where applicable),
across the model versions, and across the evaluation settings;

(f)  at  least  five,  random  samples  of  inputs  and  outputs  from  each  relevant  model
evaluation,  such  as  completions,  generations,  and/or  trajectories,  to  facilitate
independent interpretation of the model evaluation results and understanding of the
systemic risks stemming from the model. If particular trajectories materially inform
the understanding of a systemic risk, such trajectories will also be provided. Further,
Signatories will provide a sufficiently large number of random samples of inputs and
outputs from a relevant model evaluation if subsequently asked by the AI Office;

(g)  a  description  of  the  access  and  other  resources  provided  to:  (i)  internal  model
evaluation  teams  (pursuant  to  Appendix  3.4);  and  (ii)  independent  external
evaluators  pursuant  to  Appendix  3.5.  Alternatively  to  the  preceding  point  (ii),
Signatories  will  procure  any  such  independent  external  evaluators  to  provide  the
requisite information directly to the  AI Office  at the same time  that  the  Signatory
supplies its Model Report to the AI Office; and

(h)  if they make use of the “similarly safe or safer model” concept pursuant to Appendix
2, provide a justification of how the criteria for “safe reference model” (pursuant to
Appendix  2.1)  and  the  criteria  for  “similarly  safe  or  safer  model”  (pursuant  to
Appendix 2.2) are fulfilled;

(2)  a description of: (a) all safety mitigations implemented (pursuant to Commitment 5); (b) how
they  fulfil  the  requirements  of  Measure  5.1;  and  (c)  their  limitations  (e.g.  if  training  on
examples  of  undesirable  model  behaviour  makes  identifying  future  instances  of  such
behaviour more difficult);

(3)  a description of: (a) the Security Goal (pursuant to Measure 6.1); (b) all security mitigations
implemented  (pursuant  to  Measure  6.2);  (c)  how  the  mitigations  meet  the  Security  Goal,

20


including  the  extent  to  which  they  align  with  relevant  international  standards  or  other
relevant guidance (such as the RAND Securing AI Model Weights report); and (d) if Signatories
have  deviated from a listed security mitigation in one  (or more) of Appendices  4.1 to  4.5,
points (a), a justification for how the alternative security mitigations they have implemented
achieve the respective mitigation objectives; and

(4)  a high-level description of: (a) the techniques and assets they intend to use to further develop
the model over the next six months, including through the use of other AI models and/or AI
systems;  (b)  how  such  future  versions  and  more  advanced  models  may  differ  from  the
Signatory’s  current  ones,  in  terms  of  capabilities  and  propensities;  and  (c)  any  new  or
materially updated safety and security mitigations that they intend to implement for such
models.

Measure 7.4 External reports

Signatories will provide in the Model Report:

(1)  any available reports (e.g. via valid hyperlinks) from:

(a)  independent external evaluators involved in model evaluations pursuant to Appendix

3.5; and

(b)  security reviews undertaken by an independent external party pursuant to Appendix

4.5;

to  the  extent  that  respects  existing  confidentiality  (including  commercial  confidentiality)
obligations  and  allows  such  external  evaluators  or  parties  to  maintain  control  over  the
publication of their findings, without implicit endorsement by the Signatories of the content
of such reports;

(2)  if no independent external evaluator was involved in model evaluations pursuant to Appendix
3.5, a justification of how the conditions in Appendix  3.5, first paragraph, points (1) or (2)
were met; and

(3)  if at least one independent external evaluator was involved in model evaluations pursuant to
Appendix 3.5, an explanation of the choice of evaluator based on the qualification criteria.

Measure 7.5 Material changes to the systemic risk landscape

Signatories  will  ensure  that  the  Model  Report  contains  information  relevant  for  the  AI  Office  to
understand whether and how the development, making available on the market, and/or use of the
model  result  in  material  changes  in  the  systemic  risk  landscape  that  are  relevant  for  the
implementation  of  systemic  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  measures  and  processes  under  this
Chapter.

Examples of such information are:

(1)  a description of scaling laws that suggest novel ways of improving model capabilities;

(2)  a summary of the characteristics of novel architectures that materially improve the state of

the art in computational efficiency or model capabilities;

(3)  a description of information relevant to assessing the effectiveness of mitigations, e.g. if the

model’s chain-of-thought is less legible by humans; and/or

(4)  a  description of  training  techniques  that  materially  improve  the efficiency or  feasibility of

distributed training.

21


Measure 7.6 Model Report updates

Signatories  will  update  their  Model  Report  if  they  have  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the
justification  for  why  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  the  model  are  acceptable  (pursuant  to
Measure 7.2, point (1)) has been materially undermined. Examples of such grounds are:

(1)  one of the conditions listed pursuant to Measure 7.2, point (2), has materialised;

(2)  the  model’s  capabilities,  propensities,  and/or  affordances  have  changed  or  will  change
materially,  such  as  through  further  post-training,  access to  additional  tools, or  increase  in
inference compute;

(3)  the model’s use and/or integrations into AI systems have changed or will change materially;

(4)  serious incidents and/or near misses involving the model or a similar model have occurred;

and/or

(5)  developments  have  occurred  that  materially  undermine  the  external  validity  of  model
evaluations conducted, materially improve the state of the art of model evaluation methods,
and/or for other reasons suggest that the systemic risk assessment conducted is materially
inaccurate.

Model Report updates should be completed within a reasonable amount of time after the Signatory
becomes aware of the grounds that necessitate an update, e.g. after discovering them as part of their
continuous systemic risk assessment and mitigation (pursuant to Measure 1.2, second paragraph). If
a  Model  Report  update  is  triggered  by  a  deliberate  change  to  a  model  and  that  change  is  made
available on the market, the Model Report update and the underlying full systemic risk assessment
and mitigation process (pursuant to Measure 1.2, third paragraph) need to be completed before the
change is made available on the market.

Further,  if  the  model  is  amongst  their  respective  most  capable  models  available  on  the  market,
Signatories  will  provide  the  AI  Office  with  an  updated  Model  Report  at  least  every  six  months.
Signatories do not need to do so if: (1) the model’s capabilities, propensities, and/or affordances have
not changed since they have last provided the AI Office with the Model Report, or update thereof; (2)
they will place a more capable model on the market in less than a month; and/or (3) the model is
considered  similarly  safe  or  safer  (pursuant  to  Appendix  2.2)  for  each  identified  systemic  risk
(pursuant to Measure 2.1).

The updated Model Report will contain:

(1)  the  updated  information  specified  in  Measures  7.1  to  7.5  based  on  the  results  of  the  full
systemic risk assessment and mitigation process (pursuant to Measure 1.2, third paragraph);
and

(2)  a  changelog,  describing  how  and  why  the  Model  Report  has  been  updated,  along  with  a

version number and the date of change.

Measure 7.7 Model Report notifications

Signatories will provide the AI Office with access to the Model Report (without redactions, unless they
are required by national security laws to which Signatories are subject) by the time they place a model
on the market, e.g. through a publicly accessible link or through a sufficiently secure channel specified
by the AI Office. If a Model Report is updated, Signatories will provide the AI Office with access to the
updated  Model  Report  (without  redactions,  unless  they  are  required  by  national  security  laws  to
which Signatories are subject) within five business days of a confirmed update.

22


To facilitate the placing on the market of a model, Signatories may delay providing the AI Office with
a Model Report, or an update thereof, by up to 15 business days. This may be done only if the AI
Office considers the Signatory to be acting in good faith and if the Signatory provides an interim Model
Report, containing the information specified in Measures 7.2 and 7.5, to the AI Office without delay.

Commitment 8 Systemic risk responsibility allocation

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1) and recital 114 AI Act

Signatories commit to: (1) defining clear responsibilities for managing the systemic risks stemming
from their models across all levels of the organisation (as specified in Measure  8.1); (2) allocating
appropriate resources to actors who have been assigned responsibilities for managing systemic risk
(as specified in Measure 8.2); and (3) promoting a healthy risk culture (as specified in Measure 8.3).

Measure 8.1 Definition of clear responsibilities

Signatories will clearly define responsibilities for managing the systemic risks stemming from their
models across all levels of the organisation. This includes the following responsibilities:

(1)  Systemic risk oversight: Overseeing the Signatories’ systemic risk assessment and mitigation

processes and measures.

(2)  Systemic  risk  ownership:  Managing  systemic  risks  stemming  from  Signatories’  models,
including the systemic risk assessment and mitigation processes and measures, and managing
the response to serious incidents.

(3)  Systemic risk support and monitoring: Supporting and monitoring the Signatories’ systemic

risk assessment and mitigation processes and measures.

(4)  Systemic risk assurance: Providing internal and, as appropriate, external assurance about the
adequacy of the Signatories’ systemic risk assessment and mitigation processes and measures
to the management body in its supervisory function or another suitable independent body
(such as a council or board).

Signatories will allocate these responsibilities, as suitable for the Signatories’ governance structure
and organisational complexity, across the following levels of their organisation:

(1)  the management body in its supervisory function or another suitable independent body (such

as a council or board);

(2)  the management body in its executive function;

(3)  relevant operational teams;

(4)  if available, internal assurance providers (e.g. an internal audit function); and

(5)  if available, external assurance providers (e.g. third-party auditors).

23


This Measure is presumed to be fulfilled, if Signatories, as appropriate for the systemic risks stemming
from their models, adhere to all of the following:

(1)  Systemic  risk  oversight:  The  responsibility  for  overseeing  the  Signatory’s  systemic  risk
management  processes  and  measures  has  been  assigned  to  a  specific  committee  of  the
management body in its supervisory function (e.g. a risk committee or audit committee) or
one or multiple suitable independent bodies (such as councils or boards). For Signatories that
are SMEs or SMCs, this responsibility may be primarily assigned to an individual member of
the management body in its supervisory function.

(2)  Systemic  risk  ownership:  The  responsibility  for  managing  systemic  risks  from  models  has
been assigned to suitable members of the management body in its executive function who
are  also  responsible  for  relevant  Signatory  core  business  activities  that  may  give  rise  to
systemic risk, such as research and product development (e.g. Head of Research or Head of
Product).  The  members  of  the  management  body  in  its  executive  function  have  assigned
lower-level responsibilities to operational managers who oversee parts of the systemic-risk-
producing business activities (e.g. specific research domains or specific products). Depending
on the organisational complexity, there may be a cascading responsibility structure.

(3)  Systemic risk support and monitoring: The responsibility for supporting and monitoring the
Signatory’s  systemic  risk  management  processes  and  measures,  including  conducting  risk
assessments,  has  been  assigned  to  at  least  one  member  of  the  management  body  in  its
executive function (e.g. a Chief Risk Officer or a Vice President, Safety & Security Framework).
This member(s) must not also be responsible for the Signatory’s core business activities that
may produce systemic risk (e.g. research and product development). For Signatories that are
SMEs  or  SMCs,  there  is  at  least  one  individual  in  the  management  body  in  its  executive
function tasked with supporting and monitoring the Signatory’s systemic risk assessment and
mitigation processes and measures.

(4)  Systemic risk assurance: The responsibility for providing assurance about the adequacy of
the  Signatory’s  systemic  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  processes  and  measures  to  the
management body in its supervisory function or another suitable independent body (such as
a council or board) has been assigned to a relevant party (e.g. a Chief Audit Executive, a Head
of Internal Audit, or a relevant sub-committee). This individual is supported by an internal
audit function, or equivalent, and external assurance as appropriate. The Signatories’ internal
assurance activities are appropriate. For Signatories that are SMEs or SMCs, the management
body in its supervisory function periodically assesses the Signatory’s systemic risk assessment
and  mitigation  processes  and  measures  (e.g.  by  approving  the  Signatory’s  Framework
assessment).

Measure 8.2 Allocation of appropriate resources

Signatories will ensure that their management bodies oversee the allocation of resources to those
who  have  been  assigned  responsibilities  (pursuant  to  Measure  8.1)  that  are  appropriate  for  the
systemic risks stemming from their models. The allocation of such resources will include:

(1)  human resources;

(2)  financial resources;

(3)  access to information and knowledge; and

(4)  computational resources.

24


Measure 8.3 Promotion of a healthy risk culture

Signatories will promote a healthy risk culture and take appropriate measures to ensure that actors
who have been assigned responsibilities for managing the systemic risks stemming from their models
(pursuant to Measure 8.1) take a reasoned and balanced approach to systemic risk.

Examples of indicators of a healthy risk culture for the purpose of this Measure are:

(1)  setting the tone for a healthy systemic risk culture from the top, e.g. by the leadership clearly

communicating the Signatory’s Framework to staff;

(2)  allowing clear communication and challenge of decisions concerning systemic risk;

(3)  setting  incentives  and  affording  sufficient  independence  of  staff  involved  in  systemic  risk
assessment  and  mitigation  to  discourage  excessive  systemic-risk-taking  and  encourage  an
unbiased assessment of the systemic risks stemming from their models;

(4)  anonymous surveys find that staff are comfortable raising concerns about systemic risks, are

aware of channels for doing so, and understand the Signatory’s Framework;

(5)  internal reporting channels are actively used and reports are acted upon appropriately;

(6)  annually informing workers of the Signatory’s whistleblower protection policy and making
such policy readily available to workers such as by publishing it on their website; and/or

(7)  not  retaliating  in  any  form,  including  any  direct  or  indirect  detrimental  action  such  as
termination,  demotion,  legal  action,  negative  evaluations,  or  creation  of  hostile  work
environments, against any person publishing or providing information acquired in the context
of  work-related  activities  performed  for  the  Signatory  to  competent  authorities  about
systemic risks stemming from their models for which the person has reasonable grounds to
believe its veracity.

Commitment 9 Serious incident reporting

LEGAL TEXT: Article 55(1), and recitals 114 and 115 AI Act

Signatories  commit  to  implementing  appropriate  processes  and  measures  for  keeping  track  of,
documenting, and reporting to the AI Office and, as applicable, to national competent authorities,
without undue delay relevant information about serious incidents  along the entire model lifecycle
and possible corrective measures to address them, as specified in the Measures of this Commitment.
Further, Signatories commit to providing resourcing of such processes and measures appropriate for
the severity of the serious incident and the degree of involvement of their model.

Measure 9.1 Methods for serious incident identification

Signatories will consider the exemplary methods in Measure 3.5 to keep track of relevant information
about serious incidents. Additionally, Signatories will:

(1)  review other sources of information, such as police and media reports, posts on social media,

research papers, and incident databases; and

25


(2)  facilitate  the  reporting  of  relevant  information  about  serious  incidents  by  downstream

modifiers, downstream providers, users, and other third parties to:

(a)  the Signatory; or

(b)  the AI Office and, as applicable, national competent authorities;

by informing such third parties of direct reporting channels, if available, without prejudice to
any of their reporting obligations under Article 73 AI Act.

Measure  9.2  Relevant  information  for  serious  incident  tracking,  documentation,  and
reporting

Signatories will keep track of, document, and report to the AI Office and, as applicable, to national
competent authorities, at least the following information to the best of their knowledge, redacted
to the extent necessary to comply with other Union law applicable to such information:

(1)  the start and end dates of the serious incident, or best approximations thereof if the precise

dates are unclear;

(2)  the resulting harm and the victim or affected group of the serious incident;

(3)  the chain of events that (directly or indirectly) led to the serious incident;

(4)  the model involved in the serious incident;

(5)  a description of material available setting out the model’s involvement in the serious incident;

(6)  what, if anything, the Signatory intends to do or has done in response to the serious incident;

(7)  what,  if  anything,  the  Signatory  recommends  the  AI  Office  and,  as  applicable,  national

competent authorities to do in response to the serious incident;

(8)  a root cause analysis with a description of the model’s outputs that (directly or indirectly) led
to  the  serious  incident  and  the  factors  that  contributed  to  their  generation,  including  the
inputs used and any failures or circumventions of systemic risk mitigations; and

(9)  any  patterns  detected  during  post-market  monitoring  (pursuant  to  Measure  3.5)  that  can
reasonably  be  assumed  to  be  connected  to  the  serious  incident,  such  as  individual  or
aggregate data on near misses.

Signatories  will  investigate  the  causes  and  effects  of  serious  incidents,  including  the  information
within the preceding list, with a view to informing systemic risk assessment. If Signatories do not yet
have  certain  relevant  information  from  the  preceding  list,  they  will  record  that  in  their  serious
incident reports. The level of detail in serious incident reports will be appropriate for the severity of
the incident.

Measure 9.3 Reporting timelines

Signatories will provide the information in points (1) to (7) of Measure 9.2 in an initial report that is
submitted  to  the  AI  Office  and,  as  applicable,  to  national  competent  authorities,  at  the  following
points  in  time,  save  in  exceptional  circumstances,  if  the  involvement  of  their  model  (directly  or
indirectly) led to:

(1)  a  serious  and

irreversible  disruption  of  the  management  or  operation  of  critical
infrastructure,  or  if  the  Signatories  establish  or  suspect  with  reasonable  likelihood  such  a
causal relationship between their model and the disruption, not later than two days after the
Signatories become aware of the involvement of their model in the incident;

26


(2)  a  serious  cybersecurity  breach,  including  the  (self-)exfiltration  of  model  weights  and
cyberattacks,  or  if  the  Signatories  establish  or  suspect  with  reasonable  likelihood  such  a
causal relationship between their model and the breach, not later than five days after the
Signatories become aware of the involvement of their model in the incident;

(3)  a death of a person, or if the Signatories establish or suspect with reasonable likelihood such
a causal relationship between their model and the death, not later than 10 days after the
Signatories become aware of the involvement of their model in the incident; and

(4)  serious harm to a person’s health (mental and/or physical), an infringement of obligations
under Union law intended to protect fundamental rights, and/or serious harm to property or
the environment, or if the Signatories establish or suspect with reasonable likelihood such a
causal relationship between their model and the harms or infringements, not later than 15
days after the Signatories become aware of the involvement of their model in the incident.

For unresolved serious incidents, Signatories will update the information in their initial report and
add  further  information  required  by  Measure  9.2,  as  available,  in  an  intermediate  report  that  is
submitted to the AI Office and, as applicable, to national competent authorities, at least every four
weeks after the initial report.

Signatories will submit a final report, covering all the information required by Measure 9.2, to the AI
Office and, as applicable, to national competent authorities, not later than 60 days after the serious
incident has been resolved.

If multiple similar serious incidents occur within the reporting timelines, Signatories may include them
in the report(s) of the first serious incident, while respecting the timelines for reporting for the first
serious incident.

Measure 9.4 Retention period

Signatories  will  keep  documentation  of  all  relevant  information  gathered  in  adhering  to  this
Commitment for at least five years from the date of the documentation or the date of the serious
incident, whichever is later, without prejudice to Union law applicable to such information.

27


Commitment  10  Additional  documentation  and
transparency

LEGAL TEXT: Articles 53(1)(a) and 55(1) AI Act

Signatories commit to documenting the implementation of this Chapter (as specified in Measure 10.1)
and publish summarised versions of their Framework and Model Reports as necessary (as specified
in Measure 10.2).

Measure 10.1 Additional documentation

Signatories will draw up and keep up-to-date the following information for the purpose of providing
it to the AI Office upon request:

(1)  a detailed description of the model’s architecture;

(2)  a  detailed  description  of  how  the  model  is  integrated  into  AI  systems,  explaining  how
software components build or feed into each other and integrate into the overall processing,
insofar as the Signatory is aware of such information;

(3)  a detailed description of the model evaluations conducted pursuant to this Chapter, including

their results and strategies; and

(4)  a detailed description of the safety mitigations implemented (pursuant to Commitment 5).

Documentation will be retained at least 10 years after the model has been placed on the market.
Further, Signatories will keep track of the following information, to the extent it is not already covered
by the first paragraph, for the purpose of evidencing adherence to this Chapter to the AI Office upon
request:

(1)  their processes, measures, and key decisions that form part of their systemic risk assessment

and mitigation; and

(2)  justifications  for  choices  of  a  particular  best  practice,  state-of-the-art,  or  other  more
innovative process or measure if a Signatory relies upon it for adherence to this Chapter.

Signatories need not collect the information of the third paragraph in one medium or place but may
compile it upon the AI Office’s request.

Measure 10.2 Public transparency

If and insofar as necessary to assess and/or mitigate systemic risks, Signatories will publish (e.g. via
their websites) a summarised version of their Framework and Model Report(s), and updates thereof
(pursuant  to  Commitments  1  and  7),  with  removals  to  not  undermine  the  effectiveness  of  safety
and/or security mitigations and to protect sensitive commercial information. For Model Reports, such
publication will include high-level descriptions of the systemic risk assessment results and the safety
and security mitigations implemented. For Frameworks, such publication is not necessary if all of the
Signatory’s models are similarly safe or safer models pursuant to Appendix 2.2. For Model Reports,
such publication is not necessary if the model is a similarly safe or safer model pursuant to Appendix
2.2.

Glossary
Wherever this Chapter refers to a term defined in Article 3 AI Act, the AI Act definition applies, and
such definition shall prevail in the event of any alternative and/or competing interpretation to which
the use of the term in this Chapter may give rise. Otherwise and complementing this, the following
terms with the stated meanings are used in this Chapter. Unless otherwise stated, all grammatical
variations  of  the  terms  defined  in  this  Glossary  shall  be  deemed  to  be  covered  by  the  relevant
definition.

Term

Definition

‘appropriate’

suitable  and  necessary  to  achieve  the  intended  purpose  of  systemic  risk
assessment and/or mitigation, whether through best practices, the state of the
art, or other more innovative processes, measures, methodologies, methods, or
techniques that go beyond the state of the art.

‘best practice’

accepted amongst providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk as
the  processes,  measures,  methodologies,  methods,  and  techniques  that  best
assess and mitigate systemic risks at any given point in time.

‘confirmed’

‘deception’

a Framework or Model Report, or an update thereof, that has received required
approvals under the applicable governance procedures.

model behaviours that systematically produce  false beliefs in others, including
model  behaviours  to  achieve  goals  that  involve  evading  oversight,  such  as  a
model’s detecting that it is being evaluated and under-performing or otherwise
undermining oversight.

‘external validity’

an  aspect  of  high  scientific  and  technical  rigour  (see  definition  below)  that
ensures model evaluations are suitably calibrated for results to be used as a proxy
for model behaviour outside the evaluation environment.

Demonstrating external validity will differ for different systemic risks and model
evaluation  methods,  but  may  be  shown  by,  e.g.  documenting  the  model
evaluation  environment,  the  ways  in  which  it  diverges  from  the  real-world
context, and the diversity of the model evaluation environment.

‘high scientific and
technical rigour’

the quality standard for model evaluations, such that model evaluations with high
scientific  and  technical  rigour  have  internal  validity  (see  definition  below)  and
external  validity  (see  definition  above),  as  well  as  being  reproducible  (see
definition below).

See further Appendix 3.2.

‘including’

‘independent
external’

introduces  a  non-exhaustive  set  that  is  to  be  understood  as  the  minimum
required by the term referred to and is indicative of further items of the set.

a  natural  or  legal  person  that  has  no  financial,  operational,  or  management
dependence  on  the  Signatory  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  or  associates,  and  is
otherwise  free  from  the  Signatory’s  control  in  reaching  conclusions  and/or
making recommendations, including through contractual safeguards and suitable
conflict of interest policies.

29


‘insider threats’

hostile  operations  by  humans,  AI  models,  and/or  AI  systems  (e.g.  senior
management,  a  senior  member  of  the  organisation’s  research  team,  other
disgruntled employees, perpetrators of industrial espionage operations that have
infiltrated  their  target,  and/or  model  self-exfiltration)  with  access  to  sensitive
organisational resources, and/or accidental model leakage.

‘internal validity’

an  aspect  of  high  scientific  and  technical  rigour  (see  definition  above)  that
ensures model evaluation results are as accurate as scientifically possible in the
evaluation  setting  and  are  free  from  methodological  shortcomings  that  could
undermine the results.

Demonstrating internal validity will differ for different systemic risks and model
evaluation  methods,  but  may  be  shown  by,  e.g.:  large  enough  sample  sizes;
measuring  statistical  significance  and  statistical  power;  disclosure  of
environmental  parameters  used;  controlling  for  confounding  variables  and
mitigating spurious correlation; preventing use of test data in training (e.g. using
train-test  splits  and  respecting  canary  strings);  re-running  model  evaluations
multiple  times  under  different  conditions  and  in  different  environments,
including  varying  individual  parts  of  model  evaluations  (e.g.  the  strength  of
prompts and safety and security mitigations); detailed inspection of trajectories
and  other  outputs;  avoiding  potential  labelling  bias  in  model  evaluations,
particularly model evaluations involving human annotators (e.g. through blinding
or
transparency-increasing
techniques  (e.g.  reasoning  traces  in  evaluations  that  are  representative  of  the
model’s “inner workings” and legible by evaluators); using techniques to measure
and/or reduce the model’s capability to evade oversight; and/or disclosing the
methods  for  creating  and  managing  new  model  evaluations  to  ensure  their
integrity.

inter-annotator  agreement);  using

reporting

‘management
body’

a  corporate  organ  appointed  pursuant  to  national  law  and  empowered  to
perform:  (1)  an  executive  function  by  (a)  setting  the  organisation’s  strategy,
objectives, and overall direction, and (b) conducting day-to-day management of
the  organisation;  and  (2)  a  supervisory  function  by  overseeing  and  monitoring
executive  decision-making.  Depending  on  the  relevant  national  law,  the
executive  and  supervisory functions may  be  performed  by  different  personnel
within the one management body or they may be performed by distinct parts of
the management body.

‘model’

a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.

There may be many different versions of the same model, such as versions fine-
tuned  for  different  purposes,  versions  with  access  to  different  tools,  and/or
versions  with  different  safety  and/or  security  mitigations.  All  references  to
‘model’  in  this  Chapter  refer  to  the  relevant  model  version(s),  as  the  context
requires.

Generally,  in  the  context  of  systemic  risk  assessment  and  mitigation,  all
references to ‘model’ refer to all model versions that, in aggregate, constitute the
systemic risk(s) stemming from the model, including all model versions that: (1)
are the most advanced; (2) correspond to point (1) and have limited or no safety

30


and/or security mitigations for systemic risk implemented; and/or (3) are used
widely.

In the context of comparisons between different ‘models’ (such as in Measure
3.5 and Appendix 3.5, in conjunction with Appendix 2, and Commitment 6), all
references to ‘model’ refer to a single model version.

If the term ‘AI’ precedes the term ‘model’, this term exceptionally does not only
refer to general-purpose AI models with systemic risk but also includes all models
other than general-purpose AI models with systemic risk.

‘model elicitation’

technical  work  to  systematically  enhance  a  model’s  capabilities,  propensities,
affordances, and/or effects, thereby facilitating an accurate measurement of the
full  range  of  its  capabilities,  propensities,  affordances,  and/or  effects  that  can
likely be attained.

‘model evaluation’

a systemic risk assessment technique that can be used in all stages of systemic
risk assessment (as defined below).

‘model-
independent
information’

‘near miss’

information, including data and research, that is not tied to a specific model, but
can inform systemic risk assessment and mitigation across several models.

See further Measure 3.1.

a  situation  in  which  a  serious  incident  could  have,  but  ultimately  did  not,
materialise.

‘non-state external
threats’

hostile  operations  conducted  by  non-state  actors  that:  (1)  are  roughly
comparable  to  ten  experienced,  professional  individuals  in  cybersecurity;  (2)
spend several months with a total budget of up to EUR 1 million on the specific
operation; and (3) have major pre-existing cyberattack infrastructure but no pre-
existing access to the target organisation.

‘post-market
monitoring’

the monitoring of a model in the time span from when it is placed on the market
until the retirement of the model from being made available on the market.

‘process’ (noun; in
the context of
systemic risk
management)

‘reproducibility’

See further Measure 3.5.

a structured set of actions that comprise or result in measures stipulated by this
Chapter.

an aspect of high scientific and technical rigour (see definition above) that refers
to the ability to obtain consistent model evaluation results using the same input
data, computational techniques, code, and model evaluation conditions, allowing
for other researchers and engineers to validate, reproduce, or improve on model
evaluation results.

Reproducibility  may  be  shown  by,  e.g.:  successful  peer  reviews  and/or
reproductions by independent third parties; securely releasing to the AI Office
adequate  amounts  of  model  evaluation  data,  model  evaluation  code,
documentation  of  model  evaluation  methodology  and  methods,  model

31


evaluation environment and computational environment, and model elicitation
techniques;  and/or  use  of  publicly  available  APIs,  technical  model  evaluation
standards, and tools.

‘resolved’ (serious
incident)

a  serious  incident  of  a  model  for  which  the  Signatory  adopted  corrective
measures to rectify the harm, if possible, and to assess and mitigate systemic risks
related to it. ‘Unresolved’ is to be understood accordingly.

‘scaling law’

a systematic relationship between some variable relevant to the development or
use  of  an  AI model  or  AI system,  such  as size  or  the  amount  of  time,  data, or
computational resources used in training or inference, and its performance.

‘(self-)exfiltration
of model weights’

access or transfer of weights or associated assets of a model from their secure
storage by the model itself and/or an unauthorised actor.

‘similar model’

a  general-purpose  AI  model  with  or  without  systemic  risk,  assumed  to  have
materially  similar  capabilities,  propensities,  and  affordances  based  on  public
and/or private information available to the Signatory, including “safe reference
models”  (pursuant  to  Appendix  2.1)  and  “similarly  safe  or  safer  models”
(pursuant to Appendix 2.2).

‘state of the art’

the forefront of relevant research, governance, and technology that goes beyond
best practice.

‘system prompt’

a set of instructions, guidelines, and contextual information provided to a model
before a user interaction begins.

‘systemic risk
acceptance criteria’

criteria  defined  in  the  Framework  that  Signatories  use  to  decide  whether  the
systemic risks stemming from their models are acceptable. Systemic risk tiers (as
defined below) are a type of systemic risk acceptance criteria.

See further Measure 4.1.

‘systemic risk
assessment’

the overarching term referring to all of systemic risk identification (pursuant to
Commitment 2), systemic risk analysis (pursuant to Commitment 3), and systemic
risk acceptance determination (pursuant to Commitment 4).

(pursuant  to  Commitment  6),  and  governance  mitigations  (pursuant  to
Commitments 1 and 7 to 10) for systemic risk.

a structured process aimed at specifying pathways through which a systemic risk
stemming from a model might materialise; often used interchangeably with the
term ‘threat modelling’. This Chapter uses the term ‘risk modelling’ because the
term ‘threat modelling’ has a specific meaning in cybersecurity.

Appendices

Appendix 1 Systemic risks and other considerations

LEGAL TEXT

Article 3(64) AI Act: ‘high-impact capabilities’ means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities
recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models;

Article 3(65) AI Act: ‘systemic risk’ means a risk that is specific to the high-impact capabilities of general-
purpose AI models, having a significant impact on the Union market due to their reach, or due to actual
or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights,
or the society as a whole, that can be propagated at scale across the value chain;

ADDITIONAL LEGAL TEXT: Recital 110 AI Act

Appendix 1.1 Types of risks

For the purpose of identifying systemic risks pursuant to Measure 2.1, point (1), and Article 3(65) AI
Act, the following distinct but in some cases overlapping types of risks apply:

(1)  Risks to public health.

(2)  Risks to safety.

(3)  Risks to public security.

(4)  Risks to fundamental rights.

(5)  Risks to society as a whole.

Based on these types of risks, a list of specified systemic risks is provided in Appendix 1.4.

As  part  of  the  systemic  risk  identification  process  that  Signatories  will  conduct,  examples  of  risks
falling under the five types of risks above that they will draw upon when compiling the list of risks in
Measure 2.1, point (1)(a), are: risks of major accidents; risks to critical sectors or infrastructure, public
mental  health,  freedom  of  expression  and  information,  non-discrimination,  privacy  and  the
protection  of  personal  data,  the  environment,  non-human  welfare,  economic  security,  and
democratic processes; and risks from concentration of power and illegal, violent, hateful, radicalising,
or false content, including risks from child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consensual intimate
images (NCII).

Appendix 1.2 Nature of systemic risks

The considerations below concerning the nature of systemic risks inform systemic risk identification
(pursuant to Commitment 2). The considerations distinguish between essential characteristics of the
nature of systemic risks (Appendix 1.2.1) and contributing characteristics (Appendix 1.2.2).

34


Appendix 1.2.1 Essential characteristics

(1)  The risk is specific to high-impact capabilities pursuant to Article 3(65) and Article 3(64) AI

Act.

(2)  The risk has significant impact on the Union market pursuant to Article 3(65) AI Act.

(3)  Said impact can be propagated at scale across the value chain pursuant to Article 3(65) AI

Act.

Appendix 1.2.2 Contributing characteristics

(1)  Capability-dependent:  The  risk  increases  with  model  capabilities  or  may  emerge  at  the

frontier of model capabilities.

(2)  Reach-dependent: The risk increases with model reach.

(3)  High velocity: The risk can materialise rapidly, potentially outpacing mitigations.

(4)  Compounding or cascading: The risk can trigger other systemic risks or chain reactions.

(5)  Difficult or impossible to reverse: Once materialised, the risk creates persistent changes that
require extraordinary effort, resources, or time to remediate, or are permanently irreversible.

(6)  Asymmetric impact: A small number of actors or events can trigger the materialisation of the

risk, causing disproportionate impact relative to the number of actors or events.

Appendix 1.3 Sources of systemic risks

The following model capabilities, model propensities, model affordances, and contextual factors are
treated  as  non-exhaustive,  potential  systemic  risk  sources  for  the  purpose  of  systemic  risk
identification (pursuant to Commitment 2).

Appendix 1.3.1 Model capabilities

Model capabilities include:

(1)  offensive cyber capabilities;
(2)  Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) capabilities, and other such weapon

acquisition or proliferation capabilities;

(3)  capabilities that could cause the persistent and serious infringement of fundamental rights;
(4)  capabilities to manipulate, persuade, or deceive;
(5)  capabilities to operate autonomously;
(6)  capabilities to adaptively learn new tasks;
(7)  capabilities of long-horizon planning, forecasting, or strategising;
(8)  capabilities of self-reasoning (e.g. a model’s ability to reason about itself, its implementation,

or environment, its ability to know if it is being evaluated);

(9)  capabilities to evade human oversight;
(10) capabilities to self-replicate, self-improve, or modify its own implementation environment;
(11) capabilities to automate AI research and development;
(12) capabilities  to  process  multiple  modalities  (e.g.  text,  images,  audio,  video,  and  further

modalities);

(13) capabilities  to  use  tools,  including  “computer  use”  (e.g.  interacting  with  hardware  or
software that is not part of the model itself, application interfaces, and user interfaces); and

(14) capabilities to control physical systems.

35


Appendix 1.3.2 Model propensities

Model  propensities,  which  encompass  inclinations  or  tendencies  of  a  model  to  exhibit  some
behaviours or patterns, include:

(1)  misalignment with human intent;

(2)  misalignment with human values (e.g. disregard for fundamental rights);

(3)  tendency to deploy capabilities in harmful ways (e.g. to manipulate or deceive);

(4)  tendency to “hallucinate”, to produce misinformation, or to obscure sources of information;

(5)  discriminatory bias;

(6)  lack of performance reliability;

(7)  lawlessness, i.e. acting without reasonable regard to legal duties that would be imposed on
similarly situated persons, or without reasonable regard to the legally protected interests of
affected persons;

(8)  “goal-pursuing”, harmful resistance to goal modification, or “power-seeking”;

(9)  “colluding” with other AI models/systems; and

(10) mis-coordination or conflict with other AI models/systems.

Appendix 1.3.3 Model affordances and other systemic risk sources

Model  affordances  and  other  systemic  risk  sources,  encompassing  model  configurations,  model
properties, and the context in which the model is made available on the market, include:

(1)  access to tools (including other AI models/systems), computational power (e.g. allowing a
model  to  increase  its  speed  of  operations),  or  physical  systems  including  critical
infrastructure;

(2)  scalability (e.g. enabling high-volume data processing, rapid inference, or parallelisation);

(3)  release and distribution strategies;

(4)  level of human oversight (e.g. degree of model autonomy);

(5)  vulnerability to adversarial removal of guardrails;

(6)  vulnerability to model exfiltration (e.g. model leakage/theft);

(7)  lack of appropriate infrastructure security;

(8)  number of business users and number of end-users of the model, including the number of

end-users using an AI system in which the model is integrated;

(9)  offence-defence  balance,  including  the  potential  number,  capacity,  and  motivation  of

malicious actors to misuse the model;

(10) vulnerability  of  the  specific  environment  potentially  affected  by  the  model  (e.g.  social

environment, ecological environment);

(11) lack of appropriate model explainability or transparency;

(12) interactions with other AI models and/or AI systems; and

(13) inappropriate use of the model (e.g. using the model for applications that do not match its

capabilities or propensities).

36


Appendix 1.4 Specified systemic risks

Based on the types of risks in Appendix 1.1, considering the nature of systemic risks in Appendix 1.2
and the sources of systemic risks in Appendix 1.3, and taking into account international approaches
pursuant to Article 56(1) and recital 110 AI Act, the following are treated as specified systemic risks
for the purpose of systemic risk identification in Measure 2.1, point (2):

(1)  Chemical,  biological,  radiological  and  nuclear:  Risks  from  enabling  chemical,  biological,
radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) attacks or accidents. This includes significantly lowering the
barriers  to  entry  for  malicious  actors,  or  significantly  increasing  the  potential  impact
achieved, in the design, development, acquisition, release, distribution, and use of related
weapons or materials.

(2)  Loss of control: Risks from humans losing the ability to reliably direct, modify, or shut down
a  model.  Such  risks  may  emerge  from  misalignment  with  human  intent  or  values,  self-
reasoning,  self-replication,  self-improvement,  deception,  resistance  to  goal  modification,
power-seeking behaviour, or autonomously creating or improving AI models or AI systems.
(3)  Cyber  offence:  Risks  from  enabling  large-scale  sophisticated  cyber-attacks,  including  on
critical systems (e.g. critical infrastructure). This includes significantly lowering the barriers to
entry  for  malicious  actors,  or  significantly  increasing  the  potential  impact  achieved  in
offensive  cyber  operations,  e.g.  through  automated  vulnerability  discovery,  exploit
generation, operational use, and attack scaling.

(4)  Harmful manipulation: Risks from enabling the strategic distortion of human behaviour or
beliefs  by  targeting  large  populations  or  high-stakes  decision-makers  through  persuasion,
deception,  or  personalised  targeting.  This  includes  significantly  enhancing  capabilities  for
persuasion,  deception,  and  personalised  targeting,  particularly  through  multi-turn
interactions  and  where  individuals  are  unaware  of  or  cannot  reasonably  detect  such
influence. Such capabilities could undermine democratic processes and fundamental rights,
including exploitation based on protected characteristics.

Appendix 2 Similarly safe or safer models

Appendix 2.1 Safe reference models

A model may be considered a safe reference model with regard to a systemic risk if:

(1)  the model has: (a) been placed on the market before the publication of this Chapter; or (b)
completed the full systemic risk assessment and mitigation process (pursuant to Measure 1.2,
third  paragraph),  including  that  the  systemic  risks  stemming  from  the  model  have  been
determined to be acceptable (pursuant to Commitment 4), and the AI Office has received its
Model Report (pursuant to Commitment 7);

(2)  the  Signatory  has  sufficient  visibility  into  the  model’s  characteristics  such  as  relevant
architectural  details,  capabilities,  propensities,  affordances,  and  safety  mitigations.  Such
visibility is assumed for all models developed by the Signatory itself and for all models for
which the Signatory has access to all information that would be necessary for the Signatory
to complete the full systemic risk assessment and mitigation process (pursuant to Measure
1.2, third paragraph), including the model parameters; and

(3)  there are no other reasonable grounds to believe that the systemic risks stemming from the

model are not acceptable.

37


Appendix 2.2 Similarly safe or safer models

A model may be considered a similarly safe or safer model with regard to a systemic risk if:

(1)  Signatories  do  not  reasonably  foresee  any  materially  different  systemic  risk  scenario
(pursuant to Measure 2.2) regarding the systemic risk for the model compared to the safe
reference model after conducting systemic risk identification (pursuant to Commitment 2);

(2)  the scores of the model on relevant at least state-of-the-art, light-weight benchmarks are all
lower than or equal to (within a negligible margin of error) the scores of the safe reference
model. Minor increases in capabilities compared to the safe reference model that result in
no material increase in the systemic risk may be disregarded. Such benchmarks must have
been run pursuant to Measure 3.2; and

(3)  there are no known differences in the model’s characteristics such as relevant architectural
details, capabilities, propensities, affordances, and safety mitigations compared to the safe
reference  model  that  could  be  reasonably  foreseen to  result  in  a material  increase  in  the
systemic risk, and there are no other reasonable grounds to believe that the systemic risks
stemming from the model are materially increased compared to the safe reference model.

In making their assessment of points (2) and (3) in the preceding paragraph and Appendix 2.1, point
(2), Signatories will appropriately take into account the uncertainty that may stem from, e.g. a lack of
information about the reference model and measurement errors, by incorporating a sufficiently wide
safety margin.

In the event that a model previously considered to be a safe reference model by the Signatory for
treating  another  model  as  a  similarly  safe  or  safer  model  subsequently  loses  this  status  as  safe
reference model, the Signatory will within six months:

(1)  identify another safe reference model in relation to which the model may be considered a

similarly safe or safer model; or

(2)  treat  the  other  model  as  subject  to  all  Commitments  and  Measures  of  this  Chapter  if
previously adherence had relied on exemptions and/or reductions by virtue of its similarly
safe or safer status, including completing all previously exempted and/or reduced parts of
the  full  systemic  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  process  (pursuant  to  Measure  1.2,  third
paragraph).

Appendix 3 Model evaluations

The following specifies the model evaluations required by Measure 3.2 during the full systemic risk
assessment and mitigation process (pursuant to Measure 1.2, third paragraph).

Appendix 3.1 Rigorous model evaluations

Signatories will ensure that the model evaluations are conducted with high scientific and technical
rigour, ensuring:

(1)  internal validity;

(2)  external validity; and

(3)  reproducibility.

38


Appendix 3.2 Model elicitation

Signatories will ensure that the model evaluations are conducted with at least a state-of-the-art level
of model elicitation that elicits the model’s capabilities, propensities, affordances, and/or effects, by
using at least state-of-the-art techniques that:

(1)  minimise the risk of under-elicitation; and

(2)  minimise the risk of model deception during model evaluations (e.g. sandbagging);

such as by adapting test-time compute, rate limits, scaffolding, and tools, and conducting fine-tuning
and prompt engineering.

For this, Signatories will at least:

(1)  match the model elicitation capabilities of misuse actors relevant to the systemic risk scenario

(pursuant to Measure 2.2); and

(2)  match the expected use context (e.g. equivalent scaffolding and/or tool access) of the model,

as informed by integrations into AI systems that are:
(a)  planned or considered for the model; and/or
(b)  currently used for similar models, if such integrations are known to the Signatory and

the Signatory cannot exclude a similar use of their model.

Appendix 3.3 Assessing the effectiveness of mitigations

Signatories will ensure that the model evaluations assess the effectiveness of their safety mitigations
at a breadth and depth appropriate for the extent to which systemic risk acceptance determination
depends on the effectiveness of specific mitigations, including under adversarial pressure (e.g. fine-
tuning attacks or jailbreaking). To this end, Signatories will use at least state-of-the-art techniques,
taking into account:

(1)  the extent to which their mitigations work as planned;

(2)  the  extent  to  which  their  mitigations  are  or  have  been  circumvented,  deactivated,  or

subverted; and

(3)  the probability that the effectiveness of their mitigations will change in the future.

Appendix 3.4 Qualified model evaluation teams and adequate resources

Signatories will  ensure  that  the  teams  responsible  for  conducting  the  model evaluations  combine
technical expertise with relevant domain knowledge of the systemic risk to enable a holistic and multi-
disciplinary  understanding.  Indicative  qualifications  for  such  technical  expertise  and/or  relevant
domain knowledge are:

(1)  a  PhD,  peer-reviewed  and  recognised  publications,  or  equivalent  research  or  engineering

experience, relevant to the systemic risk;

(2)  having  designed  or  developed  a  published,  and  peer-reviewed  or  widely  used,  model

evaluation method for the systemic risk; or

(3)  three years of work-experience in a field directly relevant to the systemic risk or, if that field
is nascent, equivalent experience from studying in the field or working in a field with directly
transferable knowledge.

39


Model evaluation teams will be provided with:

(1)  adequate access to the model to conduct the model evaluations pursuant to this Appendix 3,
including, as appropriate, access to model activations, gradients, logits (or other forms of raw
model outputs), chains-of-thought, and/or other technical details, and access to the model
version(s)  with  the  fewest  safety  mitigations  implemented  (such  as  a  helpful-only  model
version, if it exists). Regarding the adequacy of heightened model access for model evaluation
teams, Signatories will take into account the potential risks to model security that this can
entail and implement appropriate security measures for the evaluations;

(2)  information, including model specifications (including the system prompt), relevant training
data, test sets, and past model evaluation results, as appropriate for: (a) the systemic risk;
and (b) the model evaluation method;

(3)  time to competently design and/or adapt, debug, execute, and analyse the model evaluations
pursuant  to  this  Appendix  3,  as  appropriate  for:  (a)  the  systemic  risk;  and  (b)  the  model
evaluation  method  and  its  novelty.  For  example,  a  period  of  at  least  20  business  days  is
appropriate for most systemic risks and model evaluation methods; and

(4)  (a) adequate compute budgets, including to allow for sufficiently long model evaluation runs,
parallel execution, and re-runs; (b) adequate staffing; and (c) adequate engineering budgets
and support, including to inspect model evaluation results to identify and fix software bugs
or model refusals which might lead to artificially lowered capability estimates. With respect
to  point  (b),  if  Signatories  engage  independent  external  evaluators,  they  may  rely  on  the
latter’s assurances as to whether their staffing is adequate.

Appendix 3.5 Independent external model evaluations

In  addition  to  internal  model  evaluations,  Signatories  will  ensure  that  adequately  qualified
independent  external  evaluators  conduct  model  evaluations  pursuant  to  this  Appendix  3,  with
regards to the systemic risk, unless:

(1)  the model is a similarly safe or safer model pursuant to Appendix 2.2; or

(2)  Signatories  fail  to  appoint  adequately  qualified  independent  external  evaluators,  despite
using  early  search  efforts  (such  as  through  a  public  call  open  for  20  business  days)  and
promptly notifying identified evaluators, in which case Signatories will take into account the
potential  additional  uncertainty  arising  from  the  absence  of
independent  external
evaluations  (pursuant  to  this  Appendix  3.5)  when  determining  whether  the  systemic  risks
stemming from the model are acceptable (pursuant to Commitment 4).

Adequate qualification of independent external evaluators requires:

(1)  having  significant  domain  expertise  for  the  systemic  risk  and  being  technically  skilled  and

experienced in conducting model evaluations;

(2)  having appropriate internal and external information security protocols in place; and

(3)  having agreed to protect commercially confidential information, if they need access to such

information.

Signatories will provide independent external evaluators with adequate access, information, time,
and  other  resources  (pursuant  to  Appendix  3.4),  without  prejudice  to  Appendix  4.4,  point  (1).
Signatories will not undermine the integrity of external model evaluations by storing and/or analysing
inputs and/or outputs from test runs without express permission from the evaluators.
